In this R package, we implement the recommendations from Silbert & Thomas (2013), providing up-to-date statistical methods to conduct General Recognition Theory analyses.
Following the result that failures of decisional separability are not identifiable, we focus on testing perceptual separability and independence, providing the following options:

1. Full Gaussian model fitting, with visualization (not yet implemented)
2. Tests of marginal response invariance (MRI) to detect failures of perceptual separability 
3. Test of sampling independence (SI) to detect failures of perceptual independence.
