In this R package, we implement the recommendations from Silbert & Thomas (2013), providing up-to-date statistical methods to conduct General Recognition Theory analyses.
Following the result that failures of decisional and perceptual separability are generically confounded, we assume decisional separability and focus on testing perceptual separability and independence, providing the following options:

1. Full Gaussian model fitting with visualization (constrained models not yet implemented).
2. Tests of marginal response invariance (MRI) to detect failures of perceptual separability .
3. Tests of sampling independence (SI) to detect failures of perceptual independence.
